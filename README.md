crawler.py  
==========  

*crawler.py* is a *python 3.4* script  that will very simply crawl the web for you 
It scrapes the page for any anchor elements and goes from there.

This script is still *_in_development_* and *_should_* not be used yet.

## TODO
* Make it more advanced. Get image urls
* Document better
* Refactor out to seperate modules for code clarity
* I'm sure this list will go 

## known Bugs
* Malform url's will trip the script up and potentially cause an early stop
